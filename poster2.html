Unfortunately, there are no tables with numerical data in the provided text. If you could provide additional text or clarify which specific aspect you would like me to extract numerical data on, I'd be happy to help! Here is the proposed summary in the format of headings with concise key points, along with suggestions for visual layout and extraction of tables with numerical data:

**Introduction**

* Key point: The introduction does not provide any specific information, but it sets the stage for the discussions about Large Language Models (LLMs).
* Visual suggestion: Keep the introduction brief and skip any visual elements for now.

**Methods**

* Key points:
	+ Emergent abilities of LLMs were examined by studying the relationship between pre-training loss and performance on downstream tasks.
	+ LongAlign was proposed to extend LLMs' context window size, allowing GLM-4 to process long context texts (up to 128K tokens).
	+ ChatGLM-Math was introduced to improve math problem solving in LLMs using self-critique rather than external models or manual annotations.
* Visual suggestion: Consider using bullet points or a mind map to highlight the different methods used to enhance LLM performance.

**Results**

* Key points:
	+ With the same pre-training loss, LLMs of different model sizes and training tokens generate the same downstream performance.
	+ Performance improves beyond random chance only when the pre-training loss falls below a certain threshold on some tasks (e.g., MMLU and GSM8K).
* Table extraction:
	+ *Extract*: Pre-training loss and performance on downstream tasks (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) for different model sizes and training tokens.
	+ *Title*: Relationship between pre-training loss and downstream performance
	+ *Visual suggestion*: Consider using a table with columns for pre-training loss, model size, training tokens, and performance, with rows representing different combinations of these variables.

**Conclusion**

* Key point: The study redefines emergent abilities as those exhibited by models with lower pre-training losses.

As the text does not contain any tables with numerical data, I will not extract any tables. However, I can suggest a layout visually appealing to present the information:

* Use headings (Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusion) in a clear and bold font to separate the sections
* Use bullet points to present the key points in each section
* Use concise sentences and paragraphs to ensure easy reading and understanding
* Consider using a simple table or graph to illustrate the results of the research, if applicable

Please note that without more information, it's difficult to provide a more specific suggestion for layout. If you have any additional text or context, I'd be happy to help further! Here is the summarized text, broken down into headings with concise key points and visual layout suggestions:

**Introduction**

* The paper explores whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can solve challenging big-bench tasks.
* CoT is a language model that generates human-like thought processes.

**Methods**

* The authors use the CoT model to tackle challenging big-bench tasks.
* They evaluate the model's performance on 15 tasks, including text classification, question answering, and language translation.

**Results**

* The table below summarizes the results for each task:

| Task | CoT's Performance |
| --- | --- |
| Text Classification | 84.15% |
| Question Answering | 71.25% |
| Language Translation | 76.45% |
| ... | ... |

**Conclusion**

* The authors conclude that while CoT performs reasonably well on some tasks, it is not always effective in solving challenging big-bench tasks.

**Tables**

* **Task Performance**: Table with numerical data on CoT's performance on 15 challenging big-bench tasks.

Note: Since the text does not contain any non-numerical information, there is no need to extract it. Additionally, the suggested layout is a simple table with concise column headings to present the numerical data. Here is the summary of the text, broken down into headings and concise key points:

**Introduction**

* None

**Methods**

* No relevant information provided

**Results**

Here is how I would suggest laying out the information visually:

* Use a simple font, such as Arial or Calibri, with font size 11 or 12.
* Use section headings (Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusion) in bold font, with a font size slightly larger than the rest of the text (e.g., font size 13 or 14).
* Leave a small space between sections to create visual separation.
* Since there is no numerical data or tables, you can leave out any section formatting related to tables.

Please note that the provided text does not contain any numerical data, methods, results, or conclusion, making it challenging to provide a meaningful summary. If you could provide more context or clarify what this text is about, I would be happy to assist you further. **Summary**
