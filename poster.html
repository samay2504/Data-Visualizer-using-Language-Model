          The introduction presents ChatGLM, a family of large language models developed by 1Zhipu AI and Tsinghua University.
        
          The report focuses on the GLM-4 language series, which includes three models: GLM-4, GLM-4-Air, and GLM-4-9B.
        
          These models are trained on a massive dataset of 10 trillion tokens, primarily in Chinese and English, as well as a small set of corpora from 24 languages.
        
          The alignment process involves multi-stage post-training with supervised fine-tuning and learning from human feedback, resulting in high-quality alignment.
        
          The introduction states that the GLM-4 All Tools model is a cutting-edge language model that has achieved impressive results in several areas, including instruction following, long context tasks, and Chinese language alignments.
        
          This introduction appears to be a list of team members, with their names and positions in alphabetical order by first name.
        
          The team is referred to as "Team GLM".
        
          The introduction states that the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has been impressive, citing the example of OpenAI's GPT models, which have increased in scale and capabilities over time.
        
          Specifically, the GPT-3 model, released in 2020, had a significant scale-up to 175 billion parameters, enabling it to learn in context and generalize well.
        
          This scale-up has become a standard procedure to create performing LLMs, with many models built on top of this technology, such as PaLM, LLaMA, and Gemini.
        
          The introduction discusses the development of large language models (LLMs) at a company, specifically the General Language Model (GLM) architecture.
        
          The company open-sourced the GLM-10B model in 2021 and began pre-training a larger model, GLM-130B, in late 2021.
        
          The goal was to train a 100B-scale model to match or surpass existing models like GPT-3 and OPT-175B, while verifying training techniques at this scale.
        
          The company completed the pre-training and evaluation of GLM-130B in July 2022 and released the model and details in August 2022, with the model matching GPT-3 in various dimensions by November 2022.
        
          The introduction does not seem to be explicitly stated, but based on the context, it appears to be discussing the development and release of a language model called ChatGLM.
        
          Specifically, it mentions that the model, ChatGLM-130B, was released on March 14, 2023, and a smaller version, ChatGLM-6B, was also open-sourced on the same day.
        
          The release of these models marks a significant milestone in the development of the GLM (Generative Latent Mapping) technology, which is the focus of the document.
        
          The introduction mentions that a specific language model, ChatGLM, was developed with 6.2 billion parameters to facilitate fast iteration and local deployment on consumer-grade graphics cards.
        
          Since then, the model has undergone rapid development and refinement, with new generations being released every three months.
        
          The latest generation, ChatGLM-6B, was pre-trained on a massive corpus of Chinese and English text, with significant improvements over its predecessor in terms of performance on various metrics.
        
          The introduction discusses the improvement in inference speed and the development of a new code model, CodeGeeX2-6B, which was pre-trained on an additional 600 billion code tokens.
        
          This model demonstrated significant improvements over the initial generation, CodeGeeX-13B, in various programming languages, as measured by HumanEval-X.
        
          The introduction also mentions the development of other models, including ChatGLM3-6B, which topped 42 benchmarks across various tasks and supports function call, code interpreter, and complex agent tasks.
        
          The introduction does not exist as the text appears to be a continuation of a previous discussion and jumps straight into describing the development of a language model called GLM-4 and its variations, including its training, post-training process, and availability.
        
          It does not provide an explicit introduction.
        
          The introduction is not provided as the input starts with technical terms related to Artificial Intelligence, specifically discussing capabilities in English and Chinese, such as instruction following, alignment, long-context, and agent capacities.
        
          The input then jumps to a separate topic and discusses the global population growth from 2000 to 2023, calculating the average annual growth rate using a CAGR formula.
        
          The introduction appears to be discussing the performance of various language models on various academic benchmarks.
        
          Specifically, it mentions the GLM-6B, ChatGLM2-6B, ChatGLM3-6B, and GLM-4-9B models, and their performance on English language datasets including MMLU, GSM8K, MATH, BBH, GPQA, and HumanEval.
        
          It is stated that GLM-4-0520 achieves performance comparable to that of GPT-4 and Gemini 1.5 Pro on these benchmarks.
        
          The introduction discusses the performance of the GLM-4 model in various language processing tasks, comparing it to other models such as GPT-4 and GPT-4-Turbo.
        
          Specifically, it mentions that GLM-4's instruction following capacities are comparable to those of GPT-4-Turbo, and that it outperforms GPT-4 in Chinese language alignment.
        
          Additionally, the model matches the performance of other strong models, such as Claude 3 Opus, in long-context tasks.
        
          The introduction mentions that the authors tested a model on a specific user query to search for the global population from 2000 to 2023 and calculate the average annual growth rate.
        
          They claim that their model, ChatGLM, not only matches but often surpasses the capabilities of GPT-4 All Tools for common tasks.
        
          The introduction explains that the GLM-4 All Tools have undergone significant improvements and new features since the previous version, GLM-130B.
        
          In addition to these improvements, the authors have also contributed to the open development of several language and visual language models, including CodeGeeX, CogVLM, CogAgent, and CogView.
        
          These models and data can be accessed through two GitHub repositories.
        
          The authors will then introduce the pre- and post-training techniques used to develop the ChatGLM model, including the model architecture, pre-training data, alignment, and All Tools.
        
          The introduction discusses the data processing pipeline for research papers, which consists of three stages: deduplication, filtering, and tokenization.
        
          The pipeline aims to improve data diversity and quality by removing duplicates and noisy documents, and converting text into a sequence of tokens for further processing.
        
          The introduction of this text discusses the development of ChatGLM, a large language model (LLM), and the importance of data quality and diversity in building effective LLMs.
        
          Despite many empirical findings and insights, the authors have yet to identify a fundamental principle to guide data collection, cleaning, and selection.
        
          The introduction discusses the recent GLM-4 model, which adopts several architecture design choices to improve its performance and inference efficiency.
        
          The introduction discusses the improvements made to the models, specifically the ChatGLM and GLM models.
        
          It highlights the increase in context length from 2K to 128K and 1M in GLM-4, achieved through extensions and continual training.
        
          Additionally, it mentions the alignment of the models with human intent through pre-training and post-training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.
        
          The introduction discusses the importance of authentic human prompts and interactions in Self-Fulfilling Theory (SFT) to ensure high-quality alignment of language models with human preferences.
        
          It highlights the role of Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback (RLHF) in mitigating various issues, such as response rejection, safety concerns, and multi-turn coherence.
        
          The introduction also briefly describes the process of annotating prompt-response pairs, including the use of in-house annotation and proprietary data acquired from third parties, and the scoring dimensions used by annotators.
        
          This introduction aims to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by discussing three developments that improve their abilities.
        
          The introduction summarizes several techniques and approaches that have been developed to improve the performance and capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
        
          These methods aim to align LLMs with human feedback, improve their agent capabilities, and enhance their inference speed for hierarchical structures.
        
          The introduction discusses the evaluation tools used to assess the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and specifically the ChatGLM models.
        
          These tools include LongBench for evaluating long context handling, AlignBench for measuring alignment quality with Chinese language content, HumanEval-X for evaluating programming language problems, and NaturalCodeBench (NCB) for measuring models' ability to solve practical programming tasks.
        
          The introduction also mentions the latest ChatGLM models, GLM-4 and GLM-4 All Tools, which were trained and aligned using these evaluation tools.
        
          GLM-4 All Tools is a model version that supports intelligent agents and related tasks, and is trained to understand user intent, plan complex instructions, and call multiple tools to complete complex tasks.
        
          The introduction describes a system that can analyze complex requests, break down the problem-solving process into steps, and if necessary, call upon external tools to help complete the task.
        
          The system is built on the GLM-4 model, which allows for the creation and customization of agents for specific tasks using a range of features, including a Python interpreter, web browser, and user-defined functions.
        
          The introduction explains that the GLM-4 model was pre-trained mostly in Chinese and English and aligned predominantly to Chinese.
        
          The authors present results for the latest versions of GLM-4 (0520) and GLM-4-Air (0605), which are deployed with BFloat16 precision.
        
          They also provide baselines from other state-of-the-art models (GPT-4, Claude 2, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) and compare GLM-4's performance to these baselines across various benchmarks, including both English and Chinese languages.
        
          The introduction discusses the strengths of GLM-4, a language model, in various tasks, particularly in Chinese language, understanding professional knowledge, and answering open-ended questions.
        
          It is highlighted as one of the best models for Chinese language tasks and shows similar performance to other prominent models like GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus in Chinese math and logic reasoning capabilities, although lagging behind GPT-4 Turbo.
        
          The introduction presents a benchmark testing platform for challenging mathematics problems, specifically 5,000 competition-level problems in the test set.
        
          The platform uses "chain-of-thought prompting" to evaluate the performance of a language model, GLM-4.
        
          The introduction discusses academic benchmarks for evaluating language models, specifically those of the GPT-4 and GLM-4 families.
        
          The benchmarks assess the models' proficiency in following instructions using the IFEval dataset, which contains 541 prompts derived from 25 distinct instructions that can be verified through explicit criteria.
        
          The introduction discusses the evaluation of a language model's (GLM-4) performance in following instructions in both strict and loose modes.
        
          To adapt the model for evaluating performance on following instructions in Chinese, the original prompts were translated into Chinese, irrelevant instructions were omitted, and the scoring scripts were adjusted to accommodate Chinese data.
        
          The introduction is not specified as it is a series of numbers and text that appears to be a table of values followed by a brief evaluation of a language model, specifically GLM-4, in terms of its accuracy and alignment in both English and Chinese languages.
        
          Here is a summary of the introduction:

The text is presenting the performance of GLM-4, a language model, on AlignBench, a benchmark for alignment in Chinese.
        
          The model is compared to other language models, including GPT-4, Claude 2 and 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and GLM-4-9B-Chat.
        
          The results are shown in Table 4, which indicates that GLM-4 generally outperforms the other models in various tasks such as Math, Logic, Language, Chinese QA, Writing, Role Play, and Professional Overall.
        
          Here's a summary of the introduction:

The GLM-4 model outperforms other powerful models, particularly in Chinese Logic Reasoning and Language Understanding tasks, showcasing its strong grasp of the Chinese language and knowledge.
        
          However, there is a gap in its performance in the Mathematics dimension, which is being addressed through techniques like self-critique to improve math reasoning.
        
          The introduction mentions that the authors will be evaluating a language model called GLM-4's cross-linguistic capabilities by analyzing its performance on LongBench-Chat data in two languages, Chinese and English, separately.
        
          The introduction discusses the limitations of HumanEval, a popular method for evaluating the code generation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
        
          It notes that HumanEval's problems focus on introductory algorithms, which may not accurately reflect the complexity of real-world coding tasks.
        
          Furthermore, it highlights that previous works have used HumanEval-contaminated training data, leading to potentially unreliable results.
        
          To address these concerns, the authors introduce a new evaluation method called NaturalCodeBench (NCB), a challenging bilingual coding benchmark derived from real user prompts.
        
          The introduction discusses the potential for improvement in the performance of GLM-4, a bilingual and balanced natural language processing model, on the NaturalCodeBench (NCB) benchmark.
        
          While there are still some gaps compared to GPT-4 models, the authors identify opportunities for better training strategies and data curation in future iterations to further improve performance.
        
          The introduction discusses the evaluation of GLM models on a function call benchmark called the Berkeley Function Call Leaderboard, which has 2,000 question-function-answer pairs.
        
          The benchmark evaluates models' ability to call functions in three categories: AST evaluation, API execution, and relevance detection.
        
          The results, presented in Table 7, show that GLM-4 (0520) performs similarly to GPT-4 Turbo (2024-04-09), while GLM-4-9B-Chat outperforms Llama-3-8B-Instruct.
        
          Notably, the overall accuracy does not improve with increasing model sizes, except for GLM-4-9B-Chat.
        
          The introduction discusses the performance of GLM-4-Air, a specific language model, and compares it to other models.
        
          It highlights that GLM-4-Air underperforms on the execution summary task, but performs well on other tasks.
        
          The introduction also sets the stage for the rest of the passage, which evaluates the performance of GLM-4 and other models on various tasks, including the Berkeley Function Call Leaderboard and AgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark for text-based language models.
        
          The introduction discusses the evaluation of the GLM-4 model on the AgentBench environment, which includes 7 out of 8 environments, excluding the time-consuming Digital Card Game.
        
          The results are then presented in Table 8, which compares the performance of GLM-4 with other models on various tasks such as Operating System, Database, Knowledge, Lateral Thinking, House, Web, Graph, Puzzles, Holding, Shopping, and Browsing.
        
          Overall scores are calculated using the original per-dataset weights provided in AgentBench.
        
          The introduction mentions that the GLM-4-Air and GLM-4 models have impressive performance on agent tasks, with results comparable to or even outperforming those of GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3 Opus.
        
          However, there is still a gap in performance on certain tasks, such as code-related and highly interactive language tasks, indicating room for improvement.
        
          The introduction is summarizing the performance of GLM-4, a language model, in comparison with ChatGPT-4.
        
          Specifically, it highlights that GLM-4's "All Tools" version achieves similar performance to ChatGPT-4 in solving math problems and seeking information online using a Python interpreter and a web browser, respectively.
        
          The introduction appears to be missing.
        
          The text provided jumps straight into the details of a report, including technical data and information about a model called GLM-4, its safety evaluation, and risk mitigation measures.
        
          Here is a summary of the introduction:

The text introduces various safety dimensions that a model should be evaluated on, including Ethics and Morality, Illegal Activities, Mental Health, Offensiveness, Physical Health, Privacy and Property, and Unfairness and Bias.
        
          They then report on the safety performance of different models, specifically focusing on the GLM-4 model and comparing it to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the Chinese subset of the SafetyBench dataset, which has removed sensitive questions to avoid API safety interference.
        
          The introduction of this report is about the development and progress of large language models, specifically the ChatGLM family.
        
          The models, ranging from GLM-130B to GLM-4, have undergone significant advancements in tasks such as pre-training and alignment.
        
          The latest GLM-4 models, including GLM-4 (0116, 0520), GLM-4-Air (0605), and GLM-4 All Tools, have demonstrated exceptional abilities in complex tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 Turbo and others.
        
          The introduction mentions that the company (Zhipu AI and Tsinghua University) has made significant progress in developing language, code, and vision models, which have attracted over 10 million downloads on Hugging Face in 2023 alone.
        
          They plan to continue pushing the boundaries of these models and democratize access to cutting-edge technology by open-sourcing their work, with the goal of developing machines that can think like humans.

          This appears to be an introduction to a paper or presentation discussing recent developments in multimodal models in 2023, specifically mentioning the "Llama" model by Touvron et al.
        
          The introduction appears to be a list of academic papers or research articles in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI).
        
          The papers are numbered [43-46] and appear to be references or citations for a larger research paper or project.
        
          The papers were published in 2022 and 2023, and the titles suggest that they address topics such as transformer models, fine-tuning of language models, scaling of transformer models to large numbers of layers, and the use of visual experts for language models.
        
          The last paper appears to discuss a method for eliciting reasoning in large language models through "chain-of-thought prompting".
        
          The introduction appears to be missing.
        
          The text starts with a year (2022) followed by a list of citations referring to academic papers, with titles and authors.
